    <p>Responsive design is a practice or technique web programmers carry out to match the demands of 
        their client(s) or to meet the standards of today's growing technology. To carry out responsive design, 
        web programmers must be able to understand today's market and identify the needs in their design along with
        where improvements can be made. I discovered that responsive design entails being multi platform because web
        programming is not limited to only one platform and with technology advancing, other devices can also access the web
        and may require more accomodations than the other. <br><br>
        Web pages can take advantage of responsive design by utilizing different universal methods and techniques that are
        accessible between a different number of platforms. For example, one browser may not support sans serif font
        but can support comic sans font while another browser only supports sans serif. With the font family, web pages (whether they
        can't support one font or the other) are able to display the contents of the text font because the font family allows other
        fonts to substitute the fonts not supported by the browser. Another part about
        how responsive design relates to web technologies is through adjustments that accomodate other platforms. One example is a web
        design that will work on both mobile and desktop without taking away too many features from the mobile version. Another example
        is the input type "month" in a form. The "month" input type is not supported on Firefox browser and appears as a plain text box.
        To utilize responsive design in this case, a web page must have a means to support or use an alternate layout so that both browsers
        may fill out the form without any issues. <br><br>
        I learned that in order to build web apps for different devices, it is very important for the content to be responsive. Based on personal
        experience from making this website and testing it on Google Chrome and Firefox, I noticed that the smallest differences can mean the 
        most drastic web breaking design on the other browser. On Chrome, the website was lining up perfectly the way I wanted it to however,
        the footer was off and one of my side panels was much longer in height on Firefox. Therefore, it is important to consider responseness
        on other different platforms when web programming. <br><br>
        Throughout my time in BTI225, I learned a handful of useful methods, techniques, and designs for web programming. I entered the course
        thinking that I would be spending too much time on Javascript programming but I was wrong. Throughout the term, I gained a large amount
        of knowledge on the very practical parts of web programming. When I looked at Assignment 3's code initially, I was unable to understand
        the parts outside of what I needed to do but now I am able to almost fully interpret the entire document line by line.
        Web programming is a lot of work and there are many things to remember but with consistent practice, I was able to effectively 
        learn the basics of web programming. I enjoyed my time in BTI225 and had a lot of fun.
